# Rust Learning Journey: From CLI to Distributed Applications

## Course Overview

This repository is a comprehensive Rust programming learning path, designed to take you from Rust basics to advanced distributed application development using Holochain.

### Learning Progression

1. **Basic CLI Projects**
   - Introduction to Rust syntax
   - Command-line interface development
   - Basic Rust concepts and tooling

2. **Advanced CLI Applications**
   - State management
   - File persistence
   - More complex Rust patterns

3. **Todo List Applications with Holochain**
   - Introduction to distributed computing
   - Holochain-specific development techniques
   - First Holochain project: Distributed Todo List

4. **More Advanced Holochain Development**
   - More complex distributed application patterns
   - Exploring advanced Holochain capabilities
   - Preparing for real-world distributed system design

## Project Structure
