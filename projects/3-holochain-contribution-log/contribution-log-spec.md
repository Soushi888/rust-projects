# Holochain Contribution Log Project Specification

## Project Overview
A distributed, peer-to-peer contribution logging system built using Holochain, enabling users to track and verify contributions across various projects in a decentralized manner.

## Learning Objectives
### Holochain-Specific Concepts
1. **Distributed Systems Fundamentals**
   - [ ] Understanding DHT (Distributed Hash Table)
   - [ ] Peer-to-peer data synchronization
   - [ ] Agent-centric computing model

2. **Holochain Core Concepts**
   - [ ] Zomes and DNA structure
   - [ ] Entry and link creation
   - [ ] Validation rules
   - [ ] Capability-based security
   - [ ] Signals and event-driven architecture

3. **Advanced Rust Concepts**
   - [ ] Holochain-specific Rust macros
   - [ ] Handling complex data types
   - [ ] Error propagation in distributed systems

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Contribution Entry**
```rust
struct Contribution {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    project: String,
    category: ContributionCategory,
    time_spent: Duration,
    created_at: Timestamp,
    tags: Vec<String>,
    resources: Vec<Resource>,
    status: ContributionStatus,
    verification: Vec<Verification>,
}

enum ContributionCategory {
    Code,
    Documentation,
    Design,
    Testing,
    Research,
    Community,
    Other,
}

struct Resource {
    title: String,
    url: String,
    resource_type: ResourceType,
}

enum ResourceType {
    GitCommit,
    PullRequest,
    Document,
    Design,
    Other,
}

enum ContributionStatus {
    Draft,
    Submitted,
    Verified,
    Disputed,
}

struct Verification {
    verifier: AgentPubKey,
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    comment: Option<String>,
    status: VerificationStatus,
}

enum VerificationStatus {
    Approved,
    Rejected,
    NeedsRevision,
}
```

2. **Zome Functionality**
- Create Contribution
- Update Contribution
- List Contributions
- Filter Contributions
- Verify Contribution
- Add Resources
- Add Tags
- Generate Reports

### Data Flow
```
[Agent A] <-> [DHT] <-> [Agent B]
   |             |           |
Create         Validate    Verify
Contribution    Entry    Contribution
```

## Technical Requirements

### Holochain Specifics
- Use Holochain for peer-to-peer data synchronization
- Implement robust validation rules
- Ensure data consistency across peers
- Handle offline-first scenarios

### Validation Rules
1. Contribution Creation
   - Title and description must not be empty
   - Project name must be valid
   - Time spent must be positive
   - Created timestamp must be valid
   - At least one tag required

2. Contribution Update
   - Only original creator can modify contribution details
   - Status changes must follow logical progression
   - Timestamps must be chronologically valid

3. Verification Rules
   - Cannot verify own contributions
   - Verification must include meaningful feedback
   - Multiple verifications allowed per contribution

### Advanced Features
1. **Collaborative Verification**
   - Multi-agent verification system
   - Weighted verification based on agent reputation
   - Dispute resolution mechanism

2. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Time tracking and statistics
   - Contribution patterns analysis
   - Project-based reporting
   - Personal contribution portfolio

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Granular access controls
   - Agent-based authentication

## Technology Stack
- Holochain
- Rust
- hdk (Holochain Development Kit)
- wasmer (WebAssembly runtime)

## Development Environment Setup

[Install Holochain Development Environment](https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/#2-installing-holochain-development-environment) (if not already installed)

```bash
# Create new Holochain web app project
nix run github:/holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- web-app contribution-log
cd contribution-log

# Run the development environment using Nix (instlled with the Holochain dev environment)
nix develop
```

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Individual zome function tests
   - Validation rule verification
2. Integration Tests
   - Multi-agent scenario testing with Tryorama
   - Verification workflow tests
3. Performance Tests

   - Synchronization speed

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize DHT lookups
- Efficient data serialization
- Optimize validation logic
- Implement caching strategies

## Potential Challenges
1. Complex verification workflows
2. Fair dispute resolution
3. Privacy vs. transparency balance
4. Performance with large datasets
