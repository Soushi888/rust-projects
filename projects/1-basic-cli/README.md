# 1-basic-cli: Introduction to Rust CLI Programming

## Project Overview
This is the first project in the Rust learning journey, focusing on building basic command-line interface (CLI) applications to introduce fundamental Rust programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Rust's basic syntax and semantics
- Learn how to create simple command-line applications
- Get familiar with Rust's toolchain (Cargo, rustc)
- Practice basic input/output operations
- Introduce error handling and basic control structures

## Key Concepts Covered
- Rust project setup with Cargo
- Basic variable declarations and mutability
- Simple function definitions
- Command-line argument parsing
- Basic error handling
- Rust ownership and borrowing fundamentals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust programming language installed
- Cargo package manager
- Basic programming knowledge

### Running the Project
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd 1-basic-cli

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the application
cargo run

# Run tests (if implemented)
cargo test
```

## Project Structure
```
1-basic-cli/
├── Cargo.toml       # Project configuration and dependencies
├── src/             # Source code directory
│   └── main.rs      # Main application entry point
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Recommended Learning Path
1. Examine the source code
2. Understand each line and its purpose
3. Experiment by modifying the code
4. Try adding new features
5. Practice error handling and input validation

## Challenges for Practice
- Add more command-line arguments
- Implement basic input validation
- Create simple interactive CLI features
- Implement basic error handling

## Next Steps
After completing this project, you'll be ready to move on to more complex CLI applications with advanced Rust features.
