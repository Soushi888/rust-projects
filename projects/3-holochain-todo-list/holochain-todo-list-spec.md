# Holochain Todo List Project Specification

## Project Overview
A distributed, peer-to-peer todo list application built using Holochain, leveraging the concepts from the previous Rust CLI Todo List project.

## Learning Objectives
### Holochain-Specific Concepts
1. **Distributed Systems Fundamentals**
   - [ ] Understanding DHT (Distributed Hash Table)
   - [ ] Peer-to-peer data synchronization
   - [ ] Agent-centric computing model

2. **Holochain Core Concepts**
   - [ ] Zomes and DNA structure
   - [ ] Entry and link creation
   - [ ] Validation rules
   - [ ] Capability-based security
   - [ ] Signals and event-driven architecture

3. **Advanced Rust Concepts**
   - [ ] Holochain-specific Rust macros
   - [ ] Handling complex data types
   - [ ] Error propagation in distributed systems

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Task Entry**
```rust
struct Task {
    title: String,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: TaskStatus,
    created_at: Timestamp,
    completed_at: Option<Timestamp>,
    priority: Priority,
}

enum TaskStatus {
    Pending,
    InProgress,
    Completed,
    Cancelled,
}

enum Priority {
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
    Urgent,
}
```

2. **Zome Functionality**
- Create Task
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- List Tasks
- Filter Tasks
- Mark Task as Complete

### Data Flow
```
[Agent A] <-> [DHT] <-> [Agent B]
   |             |           |
Create Task   Validate    Retrieve Task
```

## Technical Requirements

### Holochain Specifics
- Use Holochain for peer-to-peer data synchronization
- Implement robust validation rules
- Ensure data consistency across peers
- Handle offline-first scenarios

### Validation Rules
1. Task Creation
   - Title must not be empty
   - Description is optional
   - Created timestamp must be valid
   - Priority must be within defined enum

2. Task Update
   - Only original creator can modify task
   - Status changes must follow logical progression
   - Timestamps must be chronologically valid

3. Task Deletion
   - Only original creator can delete task
   - Cannot delete already completed tasks

### Advanced Features
1. **Collaborative Tasks**
   - Ability to assign tasks to other agents
   - Shared task management
   - Permissions and role-based access

2. **Synchronization**
   - Real-time task updates
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Offline support with eventual consistency

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Granular access controls
   - Agent-based authentication

## Development Milestones
