# Distributed Systems

This subsection introduces distributed computing concepts through a Holochain-based Todo List application.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand peer-to-peer distributed systems
- Implement synchronization mechanisms
- Learn conflict resolution strategies
- Explore Holochain's architectural principles

## Project Scope
- Design a distributed Todo List application
- Implement peer-to-peer data synchronization
- Develop conflict resolution strategies
- Explore Holochain's DHT (Distributed Hash Table) mechanisms
- Apply decentralized computing principles
