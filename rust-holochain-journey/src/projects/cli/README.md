# CLI Projects

This subsection focuses on building command-line interface (CLI) applications in Rust, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand CLI application structure
- Learn Rust's command-line argument parsing
- Implement modular and efficient CLI tools
- Apply Rust's error handling and input validation techniques

## Project Scope
- Create a simple, practical CLI application
- Explore Rust's standard library and external crates
- Implement robust error handling
- Design a user-friendly command-line interface

## CLI Project Tutorials

Our CLI project tutorials cover a range of complexity levels and learning objectives:

1. **Basic File Reader**: 
   - Learn fundamental Rust concepts
   - Practice file I/O and error handling
   - Understand command-line argument parsing
   - Build an interactive CLI application
