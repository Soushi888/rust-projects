# CLI Projects in Rust

This section covers command-line interface (CLI) development in Rust through two progressive projects:

## Project 1: Basic File Reader

The first project introduces fundamental Rust concepts through a simple file reading application. This project covers:
- Basic CLI structure and argument parsing
- File I/O operations
- Error handling
- User interaction

→ [Project Details](./1-basic-file-reader.md)  
→ [Implementation Guide](./implementation.md)  
→ [Best Practices](./best-practices.md)

## Learning Path

1. Start with the [Project Overview](./overview.md) to understand CLI development in Rust
2. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./implementation.md) for detailed code explanations
3. Study the [Best Practices](./best-practices.md) for CLI development
4. Complete the [Basic File Reader](./1-basic-file-reader.md) project

## Key Concepts Covered

- Command-line argument parsing
- File operations and I/O
- Error handling patterns
- User input processing
- Code organization
- Documentation practices

Each project builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts while reinforcing fundamental principles of Rust programming.
