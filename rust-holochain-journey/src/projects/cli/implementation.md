# Minimalist CLI Design and Implementation

## Introduction

This section provides a straightforward guide to designing and implementing a basic CLI application in Rust. The goal is to introduce fundamental concepts and patterns that are essential for creating functional and efficient command-line tools.

## Key Concepts

- **Simplicity**: Focus on essential features that demonstrate core Rust capabilities.
- **Modularity**: Break down the application into small, manageable components.
- **Error Handling**: Use Rust's powerful error handling mechanisms to create robust applications.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Project

- Use Cargo to create a new Rust project.
- Organize your code into modules for clarity and reusability.

```bash
cargo new my_cli_project
cd my_cli_project
```

### 2. Basic Command-Line Parsing

- Utilize Rust's standard library to handle command-line arguments.
- Implement a simple argument parser that can be extended as needed.

```rust
let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
if args.len() < 2 {
    eprintln!("Usage: {} <command>", args[0]);
    return;
}
```

### 3. Implementing Core Functionality

- Define the main logic of your CLI tool.
- Ensure that each function is focused and reusable.

```rust
fn execute_command(command: &str) {
    match command {
        "greet" => println!("Hello, world!"),
        _ => eprintln!("Unknown command"),
    }
}
```

### 4. Error Handling

- Use `Result` and `Option` types to manage errors gracefully.
- Provide meaningful error messages to guide the user.

```rust
fn read_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(filename)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to build simple yet effective CLI applications in Rust. This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more complex projects as you continue your Rust journey.
