# Minimalist CLI Project Overview

## Introduction

This project is designed as an introductory exercise to familiarize you with the fundamentals of building command-line applications in Rust. The focus is on simplicity and clarity, providing a stepping stone for beginners to grasp essential Rust concepts without overwhelming complexity.

## Objectives

- **Understand Basic CLI Structure**: Learn how to set up a simple CLI application using Rust's standard library.
- **Command-Line Argument Parsing**: Gain experience in handling user inputs through command-line arguments.
- **File I/O Operations**: Practice reading from and writing to files, a common requirement for many CLI tools.
- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling to ensure robustness and user-friendly error messages.

## Project Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Keep the codebase small and focused, emphasizing core concepts over advanced features.
- **Clarity**: Write clear and understandable code, with comments and documentation to aid learning.
- **Practicality**: Provide a real-world example that can be easily extended or modified as you advance in your Rust journey.

## Learning Path

This project serves as a foundation. Once comfortable with these basics, you can explore more advanced topics such as:
- Using external crates for enhanced functionality
- Implementing complex argument parsing with libraries like `clap`
- Adding interactive elements and advanced error handling

## Conclusion

By completing this minimalist CLI project, you'll build confidence in your Rust skills and be better prepared to tackle more complex projects. This is your first step towards mastering Rust CLI development.
