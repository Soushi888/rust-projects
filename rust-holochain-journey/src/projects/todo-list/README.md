# Todo List Application

This section explores building a more complex CLI application that manages a todo list with persistent storage.

## Project Overview

The Todo List application demonstrates advanced Rust concepts through a practical, feature-rich CLI tool that includes:
- Task management with CRUD operations
- Data persistence using JSON storage
- State management patterns
- Advanced error handling

→ [Project Requirements](./requirements.md)  
→ [State Management](./state-management.md)  
→ [Data Persistence](./persistence.md)

## Learning Path

1. Review the [Project Requirements](./requirements.md) to understand the application scope
2. Study the [State Management](./state-management.md) patterns used
3. Learn about [Data Persistence](./persistence.md) implementation

## Key Concepts Covered

### Application Architecture
- Modular code organization
- Command pattern implementation
- Error type design
- State management patterns

### Data Management
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- File-based persistence
- In-memory state handling
- Data validation

### CLI Features
- Subcommand structure
- Interactive user interface
- Robust error handling
- Data integrity protection

This project builds upon the concepts learned in the Basic File Reader project while introducing more advanced Rust programming patterns and practices.
