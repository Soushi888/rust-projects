# Distributed Todo List with Holochain

## Project Overview
This project introduces distributed computing concepts using Holochain, building upon the previous CLI todo list application. It demonstrates how to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer todo list application.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand distributed computing principles
- Learn Holochain-specific development techniques
- Explore decentralized application (dApp) architecture
- Apply advanced Rust programming concepts in a distributed context

## Key Concepts Covered
- Holochain architecture
- Distributed state management
- Peer-to-peer data synchronization
- Advanced Rust traits and patterns
- Decentralized application design

## Prerequisites
- Rust programming language
- Holochain development environment
- Basic understanding of CLI applications
- Familiarity with Rust ownership and borrowing

## Recommended Project Structure

```

## Getting Started
```bash
# Ensure Holochain development environment is set up
# Navigate to the project directory
cd 3-holochain-todo-list

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the application
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Distributed Features
- Peer-to-peer todo list synchronization
- Decentralized task management
- No central server required
- Resilient and censorship-resistant design

## Challenges and Learning Opportunities
- Implement advanced synchronization mechanisms
- Handle conflict resolution in distributed systems
- Explore Holochain-specific data validation
- Implement secure, decentralized authentication

## Next Steps
Prepare for more complex distributed application patterns and real-world system design challenges.
